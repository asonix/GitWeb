                    Red Square lies along the Kremlin's north-east wall. It is definitely th emost famous vision of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin has been the residence of the President of the Russian Federation and his Administration since 1992. For many years, the Kremlin was closed to only a select few, but in 1995 the museums located within the Kremlin walls became accessible to the public. The Kremlin has been and remains a unique monument of Russian culture and a symbol of Russian statehood.

                    The GUM Department Store takes up the entire east side of Red Square and offers visitors unique high end shopping. GUM is more of a mall housing many shops and elegant stores. In 1928 the GUM building was used to display the body of Stalin's wife. Under the Soviet Union, the building was also used to assemble the various banners, photographs, and Soviet displays of the various propoganda materials used during parades on Red Square.

                    St. Basil's Cathedral is one of the most famous and beautiful buildings in the world. It was commisioned by Ivan the Terrible and built in 1561. It is thought that the Tsar had the architect blinded to prevent him from creating anything similar to or to rival the cathedral's beauty.
