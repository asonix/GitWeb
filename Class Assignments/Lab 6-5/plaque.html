                Started in 1990 from a proposal made by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the effort was first divided between an office in building 31 of the Computing and Network Division (ON) and one in building 2 of the Electronics and Computing for Physics Division (ECP).

                In 1991 the team came together in these offices, then belonging to ECP. It was composed of two CERN staff members, Tim Berners-Lee (GB) and Robert Cailliau (BE), aided by a number of Fellows, Technical students, a Cooperant and Summer Students.

                At the end of 1994 Tim Berners-Lee left CERN to direct the WWW Consortium (WC3), a world-wide organization to leading the Web to its full potential. The WC3 was founded with the help of CERN, the European Commission, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Institute National pour la Recherche en Informatigue et en Augomatigue (INRIA), and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).

                In 1995 Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Callhau received the ACM Software System Award for the World Wide Web. In 2004, Tim Bemers-Lee was awarded the first Millennium Technology Prize by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.
