                    Splash pages go against almost every design faux pa that most designers work to avoid. They increase the time it takes to navigate the site, they are not search engine friendly, and make the visitor wait, and generally provide little if any useful information Eventually designers of business web sites recognized the problems with including splash pages and they started disappearing, now you can still find them on a few game. entertainment, and multimedia web sites, but in general most professional web sites avoid them.
