            <h1>Worth While</h1>

            It is easy enough to be pleasant, </br>
            When life flows by like a song,</br>
            </br>
            But the man worth while is one who will smile, </br>
            When everything goes dead wrong.</br>
            </br>
            And the smile that is worth the praises of earth </br>
            Is the smile that shines through tears.</br>
            </br>
            It is easy enough to be prudent, </br>
            When nothing tempts you to stray, </br>
            </br>
            When without or within no voice of sin </br>
            Is luring your soul away; </br>
            </br>
            But it's only a negative virtue </br>
            Until it is tried by fire, </br>
            </br>
            And the life that is worth the honor of earth </br>
            Is the one that resists desire.</br>
            </br>
            By the cynic, the sad, the fallen, </br>
            Who had no strength for the strife, </br>
            </br>
            The world's highway is cumbered to-day; </br>
            They make up the sum of life. </br>
            </br>
            But the virtue that conquers passion, </br>
            And the sorrow that hides in a smile, </br>
            </br>
            It is these that are worth the homage on earth </br>
            For we find them but once in a while.</br>
