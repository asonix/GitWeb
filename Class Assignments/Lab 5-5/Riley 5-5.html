                When you get what you want in your struggle for self</br>
                And the world makes you king for a day,</br>
                Just go to the mirror and look at yourself,</br>
                And see what that man has to say.
            </br>
                For it isn't your father or mother or wife,</br>
                Who's judgment upon you must pass;</br>
                The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life</br>
                Is the one staring back from the glass.
            </br>
                He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.</br>
                For he's with you clear up to the end,</br>
                And you've passed the most dangerous, difficult test</br>
                If the man in the glass is your friend.
            </br>
                You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years</br>
                And get pats on the back as you pass,</br>
                But your final reward will be the heartaches and tears</br>
                If you've cheated the name in the glass.
