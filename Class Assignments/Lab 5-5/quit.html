            When Things go wrong, as they sometimes will,</br>
            When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,</br>
            When the funds are low and debts are high,</br>
            And you want to Smile but have to sigh.</br>
            When care is pressing you down a bit,</br>
            Rest, if you must, but don't you quit.</br>
            </br>
            Life is queer with its twists and turns,</br>
            As everyone of us sometimes learns,</br>
            And many a failure turns about,</br>
            When he might have won if he'd stuck it out,</br>
            Don't give up though the pace seems slow,</br>
            You might succeed with another blow.</br>
            </br>
            Success is failure turned inside out,</br>
            The silver tint of clouds of doubt,</br>
            And you never can tell how close you are,</br>
            It may be near when it seems afar,</br>
            So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit,</br>
            It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.</br>
