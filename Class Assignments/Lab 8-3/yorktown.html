                    The Battle of Yorktown was the decisive battle between the United States and French forces, and the British. With the support of over 5,000 French forces, the United States attacked the British forces in Yorktown, Virginia, ultimately defeating the British forces where General Charles Cornwallis surrendered to General George Washington, ending the American Revolutionary War.
